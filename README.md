# ONLINE-SHOPPING-MANAGMENT-SYSTEM


The main aim and objective was to plan and program system application and to get rid of manual entry 
and to store it in a file so that easily available. We have to apply the best software engineering 
practice for system application. We developed “Online Shopping System” project, this is a small 
online shopping application that showcases the concepts of hashing. The application has been designed
to handle any number of users and includes several features to ensure a smooth and secure shopping
experience. Users are required to verify their username and password before accessing the system. 
Once logged in, users can search for products and add them to their cart for purchase. 
The application allows users to maintain a history of their orders and remove items from
their cart if needed. Additionally, the application includes an automatic billing feature 
that enables users to securely make online payments using their preferred payment method.
The system has been designed with a check on input data to ensure that all user data
is valid and secure. Overall, this small online shopping application provides users with 
a user-friendly interface for purchasing products online while ensuring that their personal 
and financial information is protected.
